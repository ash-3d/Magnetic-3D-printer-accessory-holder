A simple magnetic accessory holder for 3D printer
I designed it using Fusion 360. You can keep a spatula, a wire brush and a glue stick.
You can place five magnets(size=10mm OD) inside the part during print, for the attachment function. A pause function can be defined during the slicing process to place the magnet.
